TRAVERSO FORENSICS SUITE
   PROFESSIONAL ANDROID EXTRACTION & REPORTING
================================================================================

DESCRIPTION:
------------
Complete forensic suite compliant with ISO/IEC 27037:2012.
It consists of two main modules:
1. Extraction Tool: Exploits CVE-2024-0044 to extract app data from Android 12/13.
2. Reporting System: Generates signed PDF reports with hash verification and chain of custody.

PREREQUISITES:
-------------------
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Android Debug Bridge (ADB) installed and on the system PATH
- Connected Android device with "USB Debugging" enabled
- "traverso.apk" (Exploit payload) in the same folder
- Target device must be Android 12 or 13 (Security Patch < March 2024 recommended)

INSTALLATION:
------------

1. Install Python 3.8+:
   Ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked during installation.

2. Install Python dependencies:
   Open a terminal/command prompt in the folder and run:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Install ADB (Android Debug Bridge):
   
   [Windows]
   - Download Platform Tools: https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools
   - Extract and add the folder to your System Environment PATH.
   - Verify with: adb version

   [Linux/Mac]
   - Linux: sudo apt install adb
   - Mac: brew install android-platform-tools

USAGE GUIDE:
------------------

STEP 1: DATA EXTRACTION
Run the extractor to obtain data from the device.

   python extractor_app.py

   1. Connect device via USB.
   2. Click "Detect Device" -> "List All Apps".
   3. Select target application.
   4. Click "Start Forensic Extraction".
   5. Wait for the "SUCCESS" message.

STEP 2: REPORT GENERATION
Run the reporting tool to document the evidence.

   python forensic_report.py

   1. Go to "Case Data" tab -> Click "Select Extraction Directory".
   2. Choose the folder created in Step 1 (e.g., extraction_com_whatsapp_...).
   3. The tool will auto-load logs, hashes, and metadata.
   4. Go to "Evidence Photos" to add pictures of the device (Hashes are auto-calculated).
   5. Go to "Chain of Custody" to add custodians.
   6. Go to "Finalize" -> "GENERATE ISO 27037 PDF REPORT".
